# BASIC-M6502.rs

A modern Rust recreation of Microsoft 6502 BASIC (8K v1.1) semantics and behavior, built for learning and portability.

## Status
- Initial REPL: supports LET assignments, PRINT, and basic expressions (+ - * /, parentheses, string concatenation via `+`).
- Program storage: insert/delete numbered lines; placeholders for LIST/RUN.

## Build & Run
```bash
cd BASIC-M6502.rs
cargo run
```

Examples:
```text
PRINT 1+2*3
LET A=10
A=20
PRINT "HELLO"+123
```

## Architecture
- Lexer: crunch-like tokenizer mapping reserved words to tokens.
- Parser: minimal Pratt-style expression parser.
- Program: BTreeMap-based line storage (Rust-side replacement for TXTTAB chain).
- Runtime: simple VM state with variable table; statements dispatch.

## Roadmap
- LIST/RUN/NEW/CLEAR and execution cursor (NEWSTT semantics)
- Control flow: IF/THEN, GOTO, GOSUB/RETURN, FOR/NEXT
- DATA/READ/RESTORE, INPUT; string functions subset
- Compatibility polish and tests
