# BASIC-M6502.rs

A modern Rust recreation of Microsoft 6502 BASIC (8K v1.1) semantics and behavior, built for learning and portability.

## Status
- Initial REPL: supports LET assignments, PRINT, and basic expressions (+ - * /, parentheses, string concatenation via `+`).
- Program storage: insert/delete numbered lines; placeholders for LIST/RUN.

## Versions
- v0.1.0
  - Minimal REPL: LET assignments, PRINT, numeric/string literals, basic expressions (+ - * /, parentheses, '+' concatenation).
  - Program storage (insert/delete lines by number).
  - Test snippet (direct mode):
    ```text
    PRINT 1+2*3
    LET A=10
    A=20
    PRINT "HELLO"+123
    ```
- v0.2.0
  - Program mode: LIST/RUN/NEW/CLEAR implemented; direct mode supports colon-separated statements.
  - PRINT supports variables; '?' recognized as PRINT.
  - GOTO <line> supported in the run loop; minimal IF ... THEN (branch to line or run inline immediate statement).
  - Test snippet (store then run):
    ```text
    10 A=1:PRINT A
    20 A=A+1
    30 IF 5-A THEN 20
    40 PRINT "DONE"
    LIST
    RUN
    ```
  - Test snippet (GOTO):
    ```text
    10 PRINT "START"
    20 GOTO 40
    30 PRINT "THIS WILL BE SKIPPED"
    40 PRINT "END"
    LIST
    RUN
    ```

- v0.3.0
  - Control flow additions: GOSUB/RETURN; FOR/NEXT with optional STEP and variable matching on NEXT.
  - VM keeps simple stacks for subroutines and loops; RETURN without GOSUB and NEXT without FOR report errors.
  - Test snippet (GOSUB/RETURN):
    ```text
    10 GOSUB 100
    20 PRINT "MAIN": END
    100 PRINT "SUB": RETURN
    LIST
    RUN
    ```
  - Test snippet (FOR/NEXT):
    ```text
    10 FOR I=1 TO 3
    20 PRINT I
    30 NEXT I
    LIST
    RUN
    ```

- v0.4.0
  - Data and input features:
    - DATA/READ/RESTORE with a program-wide data pointer.
    - RUN now auto CLEAR variables and RESTORE the data pointer.
    - READ at end of data raises `?OUT OF DATA` and halts the run.
    - INPUT with optional prompt; numeric inputs must parse, else `?REDO FROM START` and re-prompt.
  - Strict type checking (classic BASIC semantics):
    - Variables without `$` are numeric; with `$` are string.
    - LET/READ/INPUT enforce types; mismatches raise `?TYPE MISMATCH`.
  - Test snippet (DATA/READ/RESTORE):
    ```text
    10 DATA 1,2,3,"HI"
    20 READ A,B$
    30 PRINT A,B$
    40 READ A
    50 PRINT A
    60 RESTORE
    70 READ A
    80 PRINT A
    LIST
    RUN
    ```
  - Test snippet (INPUT):
    ```text
    10 INPUT "NAME,AGE? "; N$,A
    20 PRINT N$,A
    RUN
    ```

## Build & Run
```bash
cd BASIC-M6502.rs
cargo run
```

Examples:
```text
PRINT 1+2*3
LET A=10
A=20
PRINT "HELLO"+123
```

## Architecture
- Lexer: crunch-like tokenizer mapping reserved words to tokens.
- Parser: minimal Pratt-style expression parser.
- Program: BTreeMap-based line storage (Rust-side replacement for TXTTAB chain).
- Runtime: simple VM state with variable table; statements dispatch.

## Roadmap
- LIST/RUN/NEW/CLEAR and execution cursor (NEWSTT semantics)
- Control flow: IF/THEN, GOTO, GOSUB/RETURN, FOR/NEXT
- DATA/READ/RESTORE, INPUT; string functions subset
- Compatibility polish and tests
